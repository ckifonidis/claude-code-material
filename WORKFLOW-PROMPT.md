## How to Use This Workflow:

1. **Select a Section**: Tell me which section number you want to work on
2. **Review Requirements**: I'll show you what's needed for that specific section
3. **Work Together**: We'll collaborate on content placement and structure
4. **Track Progress**: I'll update the progress as we complete requirements
5. **Mark Complete**: Once all requirements are met, we'll mark the section as complete

## Instructions for Claude:

When the user selects a section:
1. Check PROGRESS.md for current status
2. Display section-specific requirements
3. Ask what content they want to work on
4. Provide suggestions for content placement
5. Update progress as work is completed
6. Validate completion before marking section as done

**Remember**: Not all sections need examples. Evaluate each section's needs individually.
